Welcome to my custom Database!                                                                                                                                                                                   
This database is for expedition evil from the ether branch, the only file needing new tables is CreatureQuestLoot.sql. You can make the tables or use "all in one.sql" to make them for you. All other branchs will need to run "all in one.sql" to make your database support this set of scripts. "all in one.sql" has all the scripts made into one script and will create all the needed tables for you (at the time when they are posted). It will be updated twice a year, in June and December. Once you have used "all in one.sql" then you can apply the monthly updates.
I made some .sql for new content, if the maps are not in the latest client, then the .sql files are placed in the test zones folder. We do have some of the maps from older clients, but most of them are for looking at what we could have had.
This is my change list from the main Database. I will do updates every month.
